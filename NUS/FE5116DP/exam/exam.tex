\subsection*{Question 1 [20 marks]}

\paragraph{a)} For the function $f(x) = 4x^3 + 4 x - 5, ~x\in[0, 10]$,
describe an algorithm in pseudo code for finding the root of $f(x) = 0$ using the Regula Falsi method.

\paragraph{b)} Calculate the first two iterations of the Regula Falsi method used in a).

\subsection*{Question 2 [20 marks]} 

The function $f(x)$ is four times continuously differentiable ($C^4$).
Given 5 sample points of the function $[f(x_0-h), f(x_0-\frac{h}{2}), f(x_0), f(x_0+\frac{h}{2}), f(x_0+h)]$,
describe the algorithm to approximate $f'(x_0)$ through:

\paragraph{a)} combining the taylor expansions at the four points $f(x_0-h), f(x_0-\frac{h}{2}), f(x_0+\frac{h}{2}), f(x_0+h)$
with the goal to achieve the highest possible order of accuracy;

\paragraph{b)} Richardson extrapolation with $g(h)$ and $g(\frac h2)$, where $g(h)$ is the central difference at $x_0$ with step size $h$; 

\paragraph{c)} constructing the polynomial of order 4, $p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^4 a_i x^i$, passing by the 5 given points and taking the derivative of the polynomial at $x_0$.



\subsection*{Question 3 [20 marks]}
Consider the following one step binomial tree model of the stock price process:
\begin{figure*}[h]

\end{figure*}

a) Assume interest rate is $0\%$, compute the price of a call option struck at 100 at maturity 1 year using the method of replicating portfolio.

b) Assume interest rate is $5\%$, compute the price of a call option struck at 100 at maturity 1 year using the method of replicating portfolio.


\subsection*{Question 4 [20 marks]} 
Consider the numerical integration of 
\begin{align*}
\int_0^{2} f(x) dx, ~~\text{where~} f(x) = \frac{1}{2} e^{-\frac12x^2}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{a)} Evaluate the integral by mid-point quadrature with 4 equally spaced intervals. 

\paragraph{b)} Describe in pseudo code the algorithm to evaluate the integral using Monte-Carlo simulation.

\paragraph{c)} Define $g(x)$ as the second order Taylor 
expansion of $f(x)$ at $x=0$, write down the expression of $g(x)$ and compute the $E[g(x)] = \int_0^2 g(x) dx$ analytically.

\paragraph{d)} You would like to use $g(x)$ as control variate to reduce the noise of the Monte-Carlo integration. 
Describe in pseudo code this procedure.

(\emph{Hint: To do this, you need to collect $g(x_i)$ and $f(x_i)$ for each sampled point $x_i$.
With the vectors of $g(x_i)$ and $f(x_i)$, you can 1) estimate the variance of $g(x)$ and covariance of $[f, g]$ to choose the optimal coefficient $\lambda$ for the control variate technique and 2) carry out the Monte-Carlo simulation.})



\subsection*{Question 5 [20 marks]}
Consider the process $X_t$ under risk neutral measure
\begin{align*}
dX_t = \sigma dW_t
\end{align*}
where $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process and $\sigma$ is the constant volatility.
Denote $V_t$ the price of a derivative on the process. The risk-free interest rate $r$ is constant and the zero coupon bond process is $\displaystyle \frac{dB_t}{B_t} = r dt$.

\paragraph{a)} Derive the partial differential equation satisfied by $V(x, t)$ using the fact that $\displaystyle \frac{V_t}{B_t}$ is a martingale under risk neutral measure.

\paragraph{b)} Discretize the partial differential equation using central difference in x dimension and forward difference with explicit Euler scheme in time dimension,
write down the equation that computes $V(x, t_i)$ from the time slice $t_{i+1}$.

\paragraph{c)} Assume the risk-free interest rate is 0. Suppose that the derivative's price at $t_{i+1}$ is of the form shown in the below chart,
i.e., $V(x, t_{i+1})$ is known, 
sketch the rough shape of $V(x, t_{i})$ on top of the plot and explain the rationale.
